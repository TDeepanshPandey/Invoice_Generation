# Automatic Invoice Generation Using APEX5

I have used APEX5 for a invoice generation system. One can add project details which will be saved in the oracle database. The APEX5 allows user to have a user-friendly interface without having any knowledge of SQL. The user can generate word and pdf invoices from a predefined templates using APEX5. This will help sending invoices to customers when there are many billable employees working under managers.
